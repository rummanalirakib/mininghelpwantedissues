# Help Wanted Label Analysis in Open-Source Software Projects

## Overview

Open-source software (**OSS**) projects thrive when they effectively engage the community and encourage new contributions. GitHub offers a range of default issue labels to facilitate collaboration, with the **"help wanted" (HW)** label serving as a crucial signal for contribution opportunities. Despite extensive research on GitHub issue labeling, the **HW label** itself has not been thoroughly examined.

This study presents the first detailed analysis of the characteristics, usage, and effectiveness of the **HW label** across **100 popular GitHub repositories**, encompassing **36,212 HW-labeled issues**.

## Research Questions

### RQ1: [Insert results from your analysis]
- Our analysis reveals [insert key findings related to RQ1].

## Methodology

### Data Collection
We conducted a manual examination of **874 HW-labeled issues** to identify the reasons for applying the HW label. These issues were categorized into **three main groups**:

1. **Seeking help due to limited maintainer interest or urgency**
2. **Encouraging broader contributor participation**
3. **Requesting expertise to resolve complex issues**

### Logistic Regression Model
To understand the factors affecting the resolution of HW-labeled issues, we employed a **logistic regression model**. Key findings include:

- Promptly assigning the HW label increases the likelihood of resolution.
- The **number of expert developers** in the repository positively influences issue resolution.
- The active involvement of **both expert and mid-level developers** in issue discussions significantly increases the likelihood of resolution.

## Discussion

Based on our findings, we discuss the implications for **OSS project management**, offering recommendations on how to effectively use the HW label for maximizing contributions and resolution. Additionally, we developed a **classification model** to accurately identify **help wanted** issues at the time of submission.

## Conclusion

The study emphasizes the importance of the **HW label** in engaging the community and improving issue resolution in OSS projects. By identifying key factors that influence the resolution of HW-labeled issues, this work provides valuable insights for OSS project maintainers looking to optimize their contribution workflows.
